    <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0;">
    <p>Wistful, you called me: half in jest,
As though I floated just beyond.
But I was clearest when distressed,
Most real beneath your shrinking bond.</p>

<p>I wore your doubts like borrowed thread,
Too loose to warm, too tight to move.
I hushed my thoughts, bent back my head,
And called it grace, and called it love.</p>

<p>I knew the lie, and drank it deep,
Let hunger make the silence sweet.
The wound, at least, was mine to keep,
A place where pain and meaning meet.</p>

<p>You never saw the things I knew,
The quiet work behind the tone.
But I still bled to be with you,
And named the sorrow, being known.</p>
