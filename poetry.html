            <p><strong>The Ballad of Melancholia</strong></p>

            <p>
            Wistful, you called me: half in jest,<br>
            As though I floated just beyond.<br>
            But I was clearest when distressed,<br>
            Most real beneath your shrinking bond.
            </p>

            <p>
            I wore your doubts like borrowed thread,<br>
            Too loose to warm, too tight to move.<br>
            I hushed my thoughts, bent back my head,<br>
            And called it grace, and called it love.
            </p>

            <p>
            I knew the lie, and drank it deep,<br>
            Let hunger make the silence sweet.<br>
            The wound, at least, was mine to keep,<br>
            A place where pain and meaning meet.
            </p>

            <p>
            You never saw the things I knew,<br>
            The quiet work behind the tone.<br>
            But I still bled to be with you,<br>
            And named the sorrow, being known.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Drawer of Silence</strong></p>

            <p>
            I folded every word I meant<br>
            And tucked it in a quiet place,<br>
            Where mothless dark and linen scent<br>
            Could press it into patient grace.
            </p>

            <p>
            My voice became a paper crease,<br>
            A softened edge, a silent line,<br>
            Hoping restraint might purchase peace,<br>
            That unvoiced love could still be mine.
            </p>

            <p>
            But drawers grow stiff, and silence stains,<br>
            And paper yellows when ignored.<br>
            The truths I kept in careful chains<br>
            Became the ghosts I can’t afford.
